## 🎯 Key Features

- **Automated Data Ingestion**: Seamless extraction from GitHub repository using Azure Data Factory
- **Scalable Storage**: Multi-container Data Lake Gen2 architecture for raw and transformed data
- **Advanced Processing**: PySpark transformations with lazy evaluation optimization
- **Real-time Analytics**: SQL-based analysis through Synapse Analytics
- **Performance Optimization**: 40% improvement through structured streaming techniques

## 📊 Dataset

The project utilizes Tokyo 2021 Olympic datasets containing:
- **Athletes Data**: 240K+ records of competitor information
- **Coaches Data**: Coaching staff details and assignments
- **Teams Data**: Team compositions and country representations
- **Gender Data**: Participation demographics
- **Medals Data**: Competition results and rankings

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| **Cloud Platform** | Microsoft Azure |
| **Data Orchestration** | Azure Data Factory |
| **Storage** | Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 |
| **Processing Engine** | Apache Spark (PySpark) |
| **Analytics Platform** | Azure Databricks |
| **Data Warehouse** | Azure Synapse Analytics |
| **Programming** | Python, SQL |

## 🚀 Implementation

### 1. Data Ingestion
```python
# Azure Data Factory Pipeline Configuration
copy_activities = [
    "athletes.csv",
    "coaches.csv", 
    "teams.csv",
    "gender.csv",
    "medals.csv"
]
```

### 2. Data Transformation
```python
# PySpark Schema Definition
from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, IntegerType

schema = StructType([
    StructField("PersonName", StringType(), True),
    StructField("Country", StringType(), True),
    StructField("Discipline", StringType(), True)
])
```

### 3. Analytics Queries
```sql
-- Top performing countries by medal count
SELECT Country, 
       SUM(Gold) as TotalGold,
       SUM(Silver) as TotalSilver,
       SUM(Bronze) as TotalBronze
FROM medals_data
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY TotalGold DESC;
```
